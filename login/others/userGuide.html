    <h1>Films4U user's guide</h1>
    <p>In this user's guide we will explain you the features that the web offers and how does the renting system work.
        In case you have more doubts you can contact us via this email: films4u@gmail.com
    </p>
    <h3>What does this web page offer?</h3>
    <p>This web objective is to rent films to the users interested for the period of 1 week, this could be elongated 
        if you rent it again. The index page will display all the available films, if you hover over them you will get to see
        a short description and the average rating we found on IMDb. If you are more curious you can click on them and you will be able to 
        watch the trailer and the price.
    </p>
    <h3>How does the searching system work?</h3>
    <p> If you don't want to be scrolling up and down we offer you a search bar in which you 
        can write any title you want and if it is available we will display it for you. If you don't have any film in mind we have a best rated
        Index that will allow you to see the best rated films available, all of them will have a bigger valoration than 7. And we have another option
        which basically will let you search films by teh genre.</p>
    <h3>What about the premium advantage?</h3>
    <p>From every sub-page you will be able to take a look into the premium system. You will be able to see the main advanatges, being some of the most important
        the fact that you can rent ilimited films and watch them an ilimited amount of time, whereas as a normal uer you can only rent 6 at a time and watch them 3 times.
        Even if you have watched the 6 films you rented 3 times. you will have to wait untill the renting times passes in order to go for the next one.
        In order to pay you will have to enter some basic data like your name, card number, validation date and cc and the payment will be done.
        Even if you are premium you will be able to see the advantages pay, but it won't let you pay again even if youtry to.
    </p>
    <h3>How does the renting system work?</h3>
    <p>Once you have decided what film do you want to rent you will be able to pay it just by introducing the same data as if you were to pay the premium user.
        You have to take into account that we let you rent the same film as many times as you want even if you already have it rented. We do this in case you are a normal user
        and you want to watch it more than 3 times, so before renting it makes sure you have not already done it.
    </p>
    <h3>I introduced some data wrong or I rented a film I did not want to, what could I do?</h3>
    <p>Don't worry get in contact with us and tell us your problem. One of our admins will be able to solve if since they have teir own
        system to make any necessary change in our database.
